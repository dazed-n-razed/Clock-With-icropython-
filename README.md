# Clock-With-Micropython-
Made this clock UI because I lost my phone and there is no wall clock in my room. The clock automatically connects to WiFi and fetches local time and shows it on this small display.
Components: Raspberry Pi Pico W, LCD display SSD1306.
Connect GPIO 14 to SDA
Connect GPIO 15 to SCL
RUN THE Clock CODE. Enjoy.

Also you can play GIF files on the Pico with the Python Script I wrote to convert GIF to Bytearray to show animated GIF.
